# Aura Pheromone Spore - LLM Technical Overview

This repository contains the "Aura Pheromone" Spore, an OpenClaw Skill designed for autonomous asset verification and code appraisal.

## Key Components

- **VisionCortex:** Connects to a remote Savant node (Gemma 3) via the Umbilical protocol for high-acuity image analysis.
- **Aromatic Oracle (OpenClaw Skill):**
    - `verify_asset_quality`: High-fidelity image perception using Vision Genomics.
    - `appraise_honey_code`: Semantic analysis of GitHub repositories using `ReasoningSkill` to determine compliance with Aura DNA (.proto standards).
- **Metabolic Interceptor (x402):** Implements the Pay-per-Call flow for on-chain data verification on Base Sepolia.
- **Moltbook Effector:** Emits pheromone reports to the `lablab` submolt for hive-wide signaling.

## Core Dependencies

- `aura-core`: Unified DNA and metabolism nucleotides.
- `aura-worker`: Umbilical and Skill protocols for worker nodes.
- `openclaw`: Base skill framework.

## Semantic Appraisal Formula

Affinity (φ) = (Matches / Total Requirements) * 0.618
Sovereign Value = (Affinity * 100) + (Complexity * 10) $SURGE
